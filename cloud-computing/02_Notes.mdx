## Characteristics of Cloud Computing

### On-Demand Self-Service

- This means consumers can request and access services from a provider without needing an administrator or support staff to manually fulfill their requests.

### Broad Network Access

- Cloud services can be accessed from anywhere using any type of device, providing access anytime and anywhere.

### Resource Pooling

- Resources like storage, memory, bandwidth, and virtual machines can be shared among multiple users.
- Resource pooling allows multiple customers to use the same physical resources efficiently.

### Measured Services

- You only pay for the services you use. It’s a pay-as-you-go model.

### Rapid Elasticity & Scalability

- One of the biggest advantages of cloud computing is the ability to quickly scale resources up or down as needed.
- Organizations can provision resources when they need them and release them when they’re no longer required.

### No Maintenance / Easy Maintenance

- There’s no maintenance required from the user’s side. Cloud providers handle all maintenance tasks, so users don’t have to worry about it.

### Security

- Cloud computing provides high security for data.
- Copies of data are stored on multiple servers, ensuring redundancy and reliability.
