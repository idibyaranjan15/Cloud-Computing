# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing refers to servers that are accessed over the internet. For example, if you're based in India, it’s not necessary to save your data on a server located only in India. You can store your data on any server worldwide, based on your preference. The beauty of cloud computing is that it allows you to store, manage, and access your data remotely from anywhere.

In simple terms, cloud computing enables us to store, manage, and process data on remote servers instead of relying solely on local infrastructure.

## Service Providers

Some of the popular cloud service providers include:

- **Google Cloud**
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**
- **Microsoft Azure**
- **IBM Cloud**
- **Alibaba Cloud**

## Use Case Example

Imagine you’ve built 50 hardware systems or servers to host a website. If your website traffic requires only 20 servers, the remaining hardware resources are wasted.

Now, let’s consider an e-commerce website. If your traffic increases, you would need to manually add more servers, which can be tedious and time-consuming.

This is where cloud computing becomes valuable. With cloud computing, you can scale up (or down) your server usage automatically based on traffic demand. You only pay for the resources you actually use, making it cost-efficient and hassle-free.

## Types of Cloud Computing

### Public Cloud

Accessible to everyone. Resources are shared across multiple users.

### Private Cloud

Dedicated to a single organization, providing enhanced security and control.

### Hybrid Cloud

A combination of public and private cloud features, offering flexibility and scalability.

### Community Cloud

Shared infrastructure among organizations with common goals or requirements.
